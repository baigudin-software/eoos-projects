This repository is a **main entry point** to all the EOOS Automotive Projects, which contains aligned 
projects to build user applications based on an exact EOOS API version for all the platforms.

EOOS Automotive is **a set of C++ libraries** for different hardware platforms and operating systems 
**to develop cross-platform applications** in automotive sphere.

The libraries are developed in **C++98** programming language (ISO/IEC 14882:1998) and support features 
of **C++11** programming language (ISO/IEC 14882:2011), and this allows to consider wide criteria when 
selecting a suitable programming language on initiation step of product development.

EOOS Automotive is developed within **ISO C++ standards**, complied with **MISRA C++:2008** and 
**AUTOSAR C++14 Coding Guidelines**, and relies on **ISO 26262** that means applications based 
on EOOS **can be used in critical and safety-related systems**.

For present, EOOS Automotive is available for **POSIX** and **WIN32 API** operation systems and 
has **Sample Application** for fast start developing new user applications.
